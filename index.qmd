sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
```

Create a mount point in your /mnt directory:

``` bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/uss-foolab
```

```         
Create a credentials file - in /etc/cifs-credentials using vim or nano
```

``` bash
sudo vi /etc/cifs-credentials

username=NUSNETID
password=NUSNETPW
domain=nusstf
```

```         

Allow special permissions to cifs-credentials
```

``` bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/cifs-credentials
```

```         

edit /etc/fstab file and add the following entry

``` bash

vi /etc/fstab

//hpcnas.nus.edu.sg/uss-foolab /mnt/uss-foolab cifs credentials=/etc/cifs-credentials 0 0
```

```         

Create folder to mount network volume in /mnt and mount all volume
```

``` bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/uss-foolab 
sudo mount -a 
```

```
